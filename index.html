             Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, 
             and can be one way or round trip.
            Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>

          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important 
            to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans 
            or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, 
            gyrovagues (Wandering Monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling 
            minstrels practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.
            [8] Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally (Canterbury Tales-style) and 
            internationally.</p>
